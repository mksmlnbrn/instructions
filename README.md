# DevOps in Action: A Hands-On Guide to Building a Modern SDLC

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This bootcamp is designed to give you hands-on experience with setting up a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a simple application, using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and other free-tier DevOps tools. Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage a GitHub repository.
* Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Deploy applications to free-tier service.

# 1. Requirements

## 1.1. Prerequisites

* Basic command-line skills: Comfort with navigating directories and running simple commands in a terminal.
* Git & GitHub basics: Understanding of how to clone a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote branch.

## 1.2. Materials

# 3. Steps to Follow

## 3.1. Module 1: DevOps & SDLC Overview

## 3.2. Module 2: Setting Up a GitHub Repository

1.  **Navigate to the Bootcamp Organization**

  *   Go to the [Bootcamp2025-Pega organization on GitHub](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega).
  *   If you've provided your GitHub username to the organizers, you should already be a member. If not, please inform the organizers to be added.
  
2.  **Navigate to the Instructions Repository**

  *   For detailed instructions, refer to the [instructions repository](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega/instructions). This is the document you are currently reading.

3.  **Navigate to the movie-night-planner application repository**

  *  Please see [movie-night-planner repository](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega/movie-night-planner). This is a repository with the application we will be working on. This is an interactive UI-based application where users can build and manage a personal movie watchlist.

4. **Create your own fork of movie-night-planner repository**

   * 1. **Click the "Fork" button:**  In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the "Fork" button.
  ![Create a fork button](img/create-fork-button.png)
   * 3. **Select the organization:** Choose the organization **Bootcamp2025-Pega** to fork the repository into.
   * 4. **Rename the repository:** In the "Repository name" field, enter the name for the forked repository, following the pattern `movie-night-planner-{username}`, replacing `{username}` with your GitHub username.
  ![Create a fork](img/create-fork.png)
   * 5. **Create the fork:** Click the "Create fork" button.

5. **Navigate to your repository and get familiar with project**

  * 1. **Navigate to your forked repository:** Go to your personal fork of the `movie-night-planner` repository (named `movie-night-planner-{username}`) on GitHub.
  * 2. **Explore the codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, files, and code. Pay attention to the `README.md` file, which provides an overview of the application.

6. **Run application in Codespaces**

    * 1.  **Open Codespaces:** Navigate to your forked `movie-night-planner-{username}` repository on GitHub. Click on the green "Code" button.
    * 2.  **Create new Codespace:** Select the "Codespaces" tab and click on "Create codespace on main". This will start a new cloud-based development environment.
    ![Create codespace](img/create-codespace.png)
    * 3.  **Wait for Codespace to initialize:** GitHub will set up a virtual machine and automatically clone your repository into it. This process may take a few minutes.
    * 4.  **Run the application:** Once the Codespace is ready, navigate to a terminal. Run commands:
    ```bash
    # Run backend
    cd backend && docker-compose up
    # Run frontend
    cd .. && npm run dev
    ```
    
    **TODO**
    
    * 5.  **Access the application:** Once the application is running, Codespaces will provide a URL to access it. Check the terminal output for the URL. Click on the URL to open the application in a new browser tab.
