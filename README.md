# DevOps in Action: A Hands-On Guide to Building a Modern SDLC

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This bootcamp is designed to give you hands-on experience with setting up a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a simple application, using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and other free-tier DevOps tools. Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage a GitHub repository.
* Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Deploy applications to free-tier service.

# 1. Requirements

## 1.1. Prerequisites

* Basic command-line skills: Comfort with navigating directories and running simple commands in a terminal.
* Git & GitHub basics: Understanding of how to clone a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote branch.

## 1.2. Materials

* A laptop.
* A GitHub account (free).
  
  During the workshop we will work on GitHub Codespaces. This ensures everyone has a uniform environment, reducing setup issues.

## 1.3. Technical Setup

Before the bootcamp starts, please ensure the following:

* GitHub Account
  
  Create a free GitHub account if you don’t already have one.

* Share your GitHub username with the Bootcamp organizers so they can add you to the Bootcamp2025-Pega organization.

# 3. Steps to Follow

## 3.1. Module 1: DevOps & SDLC Overview

## 3.2. Module 2: Setting Up a GitHub Repository

1.  **Navigate to the Bootcamp Organization**

  *   Go to the [Bootcamp2025-Pega organization on GitHub](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega).
  *   If you've provided your GitHub username to the organizers, you should already be a member. If not, please inform the organizers to be added.
  
2.  **Navigate to the Instructions Repository**

  *   For detailed instructions, refer to the [instructions repository](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega/instructions). This is the document you are currently reading.

3.  **Navigate to the movie-night-planner application repository**

  *  Please see [movie-night-planner repository](https://github.com/Bootcamp2025-Pega/movie-night-planner). This is a repository with the application we will be working on. This is an interactive UI-based application where users can build and manage a personal movie watchlist.

4. **Create your own fork of movie-night-planner repository**

   * 1. **Click the "Fork" button:**  In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the "Fork" button.
  ![Create a fork button](img/create-fork-button.png)
   * 3. **Select the organization:** Choose the organization **Bootcamp2025-Pega** to fork the repository into.
   * 4. **Rename the repository:** In the "Repository name" field, enter the name for the forked repository, following the pattern `movie-night-planner-{username}`, replacing `{username}` with your GitHub username.
  ![Create a fork](img/create-fork.png)
   * 5. **Create the fork:** Click the "Create fork" button.

5. **Navigate to your repository and get familiar with project**

  * 1. **Navigate to your forked repository:** Go to your personal fork of the `movie-night-planner` repository (named `movie-night-planner-{username}`) on GitHub.
  * 2. **Explore the codebase:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, files, and code. Pay attention to the `README.md` file, which provides an overview of the application.

6. **Run application in Codespaces**

    * 1.  **Open Codespaces:** Navigate to your forked `movie-night-planner-{username}` repository on GitHub. Click on the green "Code" button.
    * 2.  **Create new Codespace:** Select the "Codespaces" tab and click on "Create codespace on main". This will start a new cloud-based development environment.

    * 3.  **Wait for Codespace to initialize:** GitHub will set up a virtual machine and automatically clone your repository into it. This process may take a few minutes.
    * 4.  **Run the application:** Once the Codespace is ready, navigate to a terminal. Run commands:
    ```bash
    # Run backend
    cd backend && docker-compose up
    # Run frontend
    cd .. && npm run dev
    ```
    
    **TODO**
    
    * 5.  **Access the application:** Once the application is running, Codespaces will provide a URL to access it. Check the terminal output for the URL. Click on the URL to open the application in a new browser tab.

## 3.3. Module 3: Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions

# TODO

### 3.3.1. Basic build pipeline

Goal: Create basic pipeline that builds project and execute tests.

1.  **Create a base workflow**


  
### 3.3.2. Execute Unit Tests

### 3.3.3. Verify pull request

### 3.3.4. Static Code Analysis
#### **SonarCloud**
SonarCloud is a cloud-based service designed to continuosly inspect your cose for quality and security issues. What it does:
* Code Quality Analisys: scans code to detect bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities
* Integration: easy integration with CI/CD pipelines, and tools like Github, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps
* Pull Request decoration: It can provide comments on pull requests with summary of its results
* Dashboard: Detailed dashboard is available

#### **Integrate SonarCloud to your project**
In order to integrate Sonar into your project follow those steps:
1. Go to SonarCould [login page](https://sonarcloud.io/login)
2. Choose login with Github
![Login with Github](img/sonar-loging.png)
3. Grand SonarQubeCloud necessary permissions
![Sonar permisions](img/sonar-authorize.png)
4. Connect to bootcamp org //TODO!
5. Generate token. In order to connect Github and Sonar you need to generate token:
* First go to My Account
![My Acocunt](img/generate-token-account.png)
* Go to Security tab, enter token name of your choosing, generate token
![Security tab](img/sonar-generating-token.png)
6. Now you need to add token to Github secrets. Enter name and contents of your secret.
